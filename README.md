# DejaVu_app
The program will function as a game, where the objective is to test the user’s memory as they must recall each integer in a list in the correct order. The game begins with the “computer” temporarily displaying a list of one random integer, the user then has to type the integer that was displayed. The next round begins with the computer appending another random integer to the list, and displays it again. The process repeats until the user is unable to recall the list of integers in correct order. If the user successfully passes each round, upto a set amount of rounds defined by the user, then the user wins. The difficulty of the game increases as the length of the list of integer values increases as well.
